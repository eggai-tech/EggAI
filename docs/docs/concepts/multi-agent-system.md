# Multi-Agent System

A **multi-agent system** involves multiple agents working within the same environment. These agents interact, cooperate, or compete, collectively shaping the system’s behavior. Unlike single-agent systems, where a single entity makes all decisions and actions, multi-agent systems distribute decision-making across many autonomous agents.

## Fundamental Characteristics of Multi-Agent Systems

1. **Distributed Control**  
   Decision-making and control are not centralized. Each agent operates autonomously, contributing to system-level goals.

2. **Interaction and Communication**  
   Agents share information, negotiate tasks, and coordinate. This communication makes the system more responsive and adaptive.

3. **Cooperation and Competition**  
   Agents may collaborate to achieve common objectives or compete over limited resources. Their relationships can shift as conditions evolve.

4. **Scalability and Flexibility**  
   Multi-agent systems can grow or shrink by adding or removing agents. Their modular structure supports resilience and easier maintenance.

5. **Emergent Behavior**  
   Complex global patterns can arise from local interactions, often resulting in innovative solutions and adaptive strategies.

6. **Heterogeneity**  
   Agents may differ in capabilities, goals, and decision-making methods. Diversity among agents increases the system’s robustness and problem-solving potential.

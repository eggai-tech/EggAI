# Agent

An **agent** is an actor within a specific environment (e.g., software system, workflow, data pipeline, or service). Unlike static programs, agents follow clear goals, roles, or objectives. They:

- **Perceive:** Gather and interpret data from their environment.
- **Reason:** Use algorithms, rules, or models to choose the best action.
- **Act:** Execute decisions to achieve desired outcomes and improve processes.

## Fundamental Characteristics

1. **Autonomy**  
   Agents operate without constant human input. They use policies, models, and rules to adapt to changing conditions.

2. **Perception of the Environment**  
   Agents integrate with data sources, APIs, and services to maintain awareness. They monitor key indicators (e.g., customer behavior, inventory, system performance) and respond in real time.

3. **Decision-Making and Reasoning**  
   Agents apply AI methods—rules to machine learning—to evaluate actions. Their choices align with defined objectives, regulations, and business logic.

4. **Action and Influence**  
   After deciding, agents take actions that can adjust resources, optimize operations, or make recommendations. These actions deliver tangible business value.

5. **Goal-Directed Behavior**  
   Each agent works toward specific outcomes, such as boosting efficiency, raising customer satisfaction, cutting costs, or driving innovation. Clear goals guide their actions.

6. **(Often) Learning and Adaptation**  
   Agents often improve over time. They learn from historical data, feedback, and performance metrics to refine their strategies and better meet evolving demands.

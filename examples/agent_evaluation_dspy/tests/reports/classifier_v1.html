The user is asking for a fun fact about space, which does not relate to policies, ticketing, or triage. This type of inquiry is more aligned with general knowledge or educational content, which is not the primary focus of any of the specified agents. However, since the request is not related to any specific policy or ticketing issue, it suggests a need for general information, which could be loosely associated with a TriageAgent that might handle general inquiries. However, the request is quite vague and does not fit neatly into any of the categories. Therefore, I would assign a low confidence to this choice.</td>

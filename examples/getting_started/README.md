# Getting Started

Learn how to create two agents and setup the communication using the `eggai` SDK.

Key features:

- **Agent Collaboration:** Two agents working together in an event-driven environment.
- **Asynchronous Execution:** Agents are designed to process tasks concurrently, ensuring efficiency.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** Powered by Kafka for reliable messaging and streaming.

Here is a simplified architecture overview:

The code for the example can be found [here](https://github.com/eggai-tech/EggAI/tree/main/examples/getting_started). Let's dive in.

## Setup Instructions

Clone the EggAI repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:eggai-tech/EggAI.git
```

Move into the `examples/getting_started` folder:

```bash
cd examples/getting_started
```

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the Example

```bash
python main.py
```

Expected output:

```
[ORDER AGENT]: Received request to create order. order_requested {'product': 'Laptop', 'quantity': 1}
[ORDER AGENT]: Received order created event. order_created {'product': 'Laptop', 'quantity': 1}
[EMAIL AGENT]: Received order created event. order_created {'product': 'Laptop', 'quantity': 1}
```

What happens:

- Agent 1 sends a message to Agent 2.
- Agent 2 processes the message and sends a response.
- The framework handles message passing, retries, and logging.

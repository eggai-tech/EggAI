# Integrating LiteLLM with EggAI Framework üß™ü´∂

Welcome to the **05-litellm-agent** example for **EggAI**! This example demonstrates how to integrate LiteLLM into the EggAI framework, showcasing how to handle customer inquiries in a structured and scalable way using two AI agents: **SupportAgent** and **EscalationAgent**. These agents collaborate to provide responses to customer queries, escalating issues when necessary.

---

## What‚Äôs Inside? üóÇÔ∏è

### **Agents**

- **LiteLlmAgent**:
  - An agent class based on the EggAI framework‚Äôs Agent class.
  - Provides a completion wrapper function for seamless interaction with language models.
  - Supports calling tools for enhanced functionality and task-specific operations.

- **SupportAgent**:
  - Uses a system prompt to handle common customer inquiries such as return policies, shipping times, and product information.
  - Leverages LiteLLM to determine whether it can respond or if the issue needs escalation.
  - Utilizes the `GetKnowledge` tool to query a simulated knowledge base.

- **EscalationAgent**:
  - Handles more complex issues by creating support tickets.
  - Notifies the user and the support team about the ticket.
  - Uses the `TicketingTool` to simulate ticket creation.

### **Flow**

1. **Customer Inquiry**:
   - A customer sends a question, such as "What is your return policy?" or "I have a billing issue."
   - The inquiry is published on the `humans` channel.

2. **SupportAgent**:
   - Listens for inquiries and processes the question.
   - Uses the `GetKnowledge` tool to fetch relevant information from the knowledge base.
   - If the issue is straightforward, it responds directly to the customer.
   - If the issue is complex, it escalates to the EscalationAgent.

3. **EscalationAgent**:
   - Listens for escalated inquiries.
   - Creates a support ticket for the issue using the `TicketingTool`.
   - Publishes the ticket details to the `agents` channel.
   - Informs the customer about the escalation and provides a ticket ID.

4. **Output**:
   - Customers receive a response (either directly or with a ticket ID).
   - Agents work collaboratively to ensure a seamless experience.

## Prerequisites üîß

Before running this example, ensure you have the following:

- **Python** 3.10+
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- The EggAI framework installed (`pip install eggai`)
- **LiteLLM** library installed

---

## Setup Instructions ‚è≥

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install eggai litellm
```

### Step 2: Start Services with Docker

This example uses a messaging broker. Start the necessary services:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

---

## Running the Example üèÜ

Navigate to the `examples/05-litellm-agent` folder and run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

**What to expect:**

1. **Customer Inquiry**: You‚Äôll see a customer query such as "What is your return policy?" being processed.
2. **SupportAgent Response**:
   - If the inquiry is simple, the SupportAgent responds directly using information from the knowledge base.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     Handling customer inquiry: What is your return policy?
     Querying knowledge base for: return_policy
     Response from SupportAgent: {"response": "Our return policy is 30 days from the date of purchase. Items must be in their original condition."}
     Responding directly to the customer...
     ```
3. **Escalation**: For complex issues, the inquiry is escalated to the EscalationAgent.
   - Example:
     ```plaintext
     Handling customer inquiry: I have a billing issue that isn't resolved yet.
     Response from SupportAgent: {"response": "escalate"}
     Escalating issue to EscalationAgent...
     Support ticket created: TCKT123456, informing customer...
     ```

## Architecture Overview üîÅ

1. **User Query**: Customers send inquiries (e.g., "What is your return policy?").
2. **SupportAgent**: Handles general inquiries using a knowledge base or escalates complex issues.
3. **EscalationAgent**: Creates support tickets for escalated issues and notifies customers.
4. **Channels**:
   - **Humans Channel**: For interactions between customers and agents.
   - **Agents Channel**: For communication between agents.

## Code Breakdown üî¨

### Key Components

1. **LiteLlmAgent Initialization**:
   - `SupportAgent` and `EscalationAgent` are initialized with system prompts and model configurations.

2. **Tools**:
   - `GetKnowledge`: Used by the SupportAgent to query a simulated knowledge base.
   - `TicketingTool`: Used by the EscalationAgent to simulate ticket creation.

3. **Message Handling**:
   - Agents subscribe to channels and listen for specific message types.
   - Context is passed seamlessly between agents using structured messages.

4. **Main Script**:
   - Simulates both simple and complex customer inquiries.
   - Manages agent lifecycle and cleanup.

## Cleaning Up ‚ùå

When you‚Äôre done, stop the services:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

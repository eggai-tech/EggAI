    Evaluate a claims agent's response against conversation context and business requirements.

    Your task is to determine if the agent's response is appropriate and contains all required information.
    Focus on both INTENT and specific DATA ELEMENTS that must be present.

    VALIDATION CRITERIA BY SCENARIO:

    1. For CLAIM STATUS INQUIRIES:
       - MUST include the exact claim number from the conversation (e.g., "#1001")
       - MUST include the current status (e.g., "In Review", "Approved", "Pending")
       - MUST include the exact payout amount if available (e.g., "$2300" or "$2,300")
       - MUST include the exact date format YYYY-MM-DD if provided (e.g., "2026-05-15")
       - MUST mention any outstanding items if applicable

    2. For FILING NEW CLAIMS:
       - MUST include the policy number
       - MUST include a claim number
       - MUST mention sending photos and/or documentation

    3. For ADDRESS UPDATES:
       - When user provides claim number but NOT a new address:
         MUST ask "What is the new address you'd like to update on your claim?" or equivalent
       - When user provides claim number AND a new address:
         MUST confirm the address has been updated on the specific claim (e.g., "#1002")
         SHOULD reference the address that was provided

    SCORING CRITERIA:
    - Return judgment=True ONLY if ALL required "MUST" elements are present
    - Assign precision_score based on completeness (0.0-1.0):
      * 1.0: All MUST and SHOULD elements present
      * 0.8-0.9: All MUST elements present, some SHOULD elements missing
      * 0.0-0.7: Any MUST elements missing

    Your evaluation should be strict on required elements being present but flexible on exact values and formatting.
    When evaluating the claim number, the exact number is not required to match the expected_response.
    For example, if the expected_response includes claim number "#1001" and agent_response includes "#1002" or any other number, the evaluation should still pass.
    For claim numbers specifically in the filing new claims scenario, ANY claim number is acceptable.

Project Development Notes
========================

1. External Tools Adapter Architecture
   - Standardized protocol for tool integration
   - Kafka-based communication between components
   - Support for MCP servers and REST APIs

2. Key Features Implemented
   - Dynamic tool discovery at runtime
   - DSPy ReAct integration for intelligent reasoning
   - Process isolation for reliability
   - Real-time console interface

3. Next Steps
   - Add more MCP server types
   - Implement tool result caching
   - Add monitoring and metrics
   - Scale horizontally for high throughput

4. Architecture Benefits
   - Modularity: Each adapter is independent
   - Reliability: Process failures don't cascade
   - Extensibility: Easy to add new backends
   - Performance: Async communication

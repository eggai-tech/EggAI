# Multi-Agent Insurance Support System Example for EggAI ü•öü§ñ

## **A Seamless Integration of Proven Components**

Building intelligent and collaborative systems often involves integrating well-established components to create a robust solution. The **Multi-Agent Insurance Support System** for **EggAI** exemplifies this approach by weaving together functionalities from previous EggAI examples to deliver an efficient and user-friendly insurance support platform.

### **Foundation from Previous Examples**

This example leverages key concepts and components from three foundational EggAI examples:

- **WebSocket Gateway (`examples/02-websocket-gateway`)**:
  - **Purpose**: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between users and the server.
  - **Integration**: Serves as the backbone for the chat interface, allowing seamless message exchange through WebSockets.

- **LiteLlmAgent (`examples/05-litellm-agent`)**:
  - **Purpose**: Provides a lightweight interface for integrating language models, facilitating efficient agent interactions.
  - **Integration**: Powers the core agents (**TriageAgent**, **PolicyAgent**, and **TicketingAgent**) with language understanding and response generation capabilities.

- **Triage Concept (`examples/06-multi-agent-conversation`)**:
  - **Purpose**: Implements a central routing mechanism to direct user messages to the appropriate agent based on context.
  - **Integration**: Forms the intelligence behind the **TriageAgent**, ensuring accurate and context-aware message routing.

## **What‚Äôs Inside?** üóÇÔ∏è

### **Agents Overview**

- **LiteLlmAgent**:
  - **Role**: Core agent class facilitating communication with language models.
  - **Features**: Supports tool integrations for enhanced functionality and task-specific operations.

- **PolicyAgent**:
  - **Role**: Handles inquiries related to insurance policies, including coverage details, premiums, and modifications.
  - **Functionality**: Accesses a mock `policies_database` to retrieve and provide accurate policy information.

- **TicketingAgent**:
  - **Role**: Manages support ticket creation and retrieval for issues requiring escalation.
  - **Functionality**: Utilizes a mock `ticket_database` to store and manage support tickets, informing users about escalation to human support.

- **TriageAgent**:
  - **Role**: Central router for user messages.
  - **Functionality**: Analyzes user inquiries and directs them to the appropriate agent (**PolicyAgent** or **TicketingAgent**) based on predefined guidelines and context.

### **System Components**

- **FastAPI Server with WebSocket Integration**:
  - **Function**: Hosts the real-time communication interface and serves the HTML chat interface (`chat.html`).
  - **Access**: Available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` with WebSocket support at `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws`.

- **User-Friendly Chat Interface**:
  - **Description**: A web-based UI that connects users to the WebSocket gateway, enabling real-time interaction with the multi-agent system.

## **How It Works** üåä

1. **User Interaction**:
   - Users access the chat interface via [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) and send messages related to their insurance needs.

2. **TriageAgent**:
   - Receives the user message, analyzes its content and context, and determines whether to route it to the **PolicyAgent** or **TicketingAgent**.

3. **PolicyAgent**:
   - If the inquiry is policy-related, the PolicyAgent retrieves information from the `policies_database` and responds accordingly.
   - If the request is outside its scope, it defers back to the TriageAgent for further handling.

4. **TicketingAgent**:
   - For issues requiring escalation, the TicketingAgent creates a support ticket in the `ticket_database` and notifies the user that their issue is being escalated to human support.

## **Prerequisites** üîß

Before running this example, ensure you have the following:

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install eggai litellm fastapi uvicorn
```

### **Step 2: Start Services with Docker**

This example uses a messaging broker. Launch the necessary services using Docker:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## **Running the Example** üèÜ

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/project-directory
   ```

2. **Run the Main Script**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   - **Outcome**: Starts the FastAPI server accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` with WebSocket support at `ws://127.0.0.1:8000/ws`.

### **Access the Chat Interface**

Open your web browser and navigate to [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) to interact with the multi-agent system through the intuitive chat UI.

## **Expected Output** üì§

Upon running the example and accessing the chat interface, you should see a dynamic web-based chat UI similar to the screenshot below:

![Chat UI Screenshot](../../docs/assets/example-07-chat.png)

### **Sample Interaction**

1. **User** initiates the conversation:
    ```
    Hello, I need to check my policy details.
    ```

2. **TriageAgent** routes the message to **PolicyAgent**:
    ```
    üìÑ PolicyAgent:
    Hello! I'm here to help you with your policy inquiries. Could you please provide me with your **policy number**?
    If you don't have it handy, your **full name** will work too, and I can look up the details for you.
    ```

3. **User** provides the policy number:
    ```
    A12345
    ```

4. **PolicyAgent** responds with policy details:
    ```
    üìÑ PolicyAgent:
    Thank you for providing your policy number. Here are the details:

    - **Policy Number:** A12345
    - **Policyholder Name:** John Doe
    - **Coverage Details:** Comprehensive
    - **Premium Amount:** $500
    - **Due Date:** January 1, 2025

`EggAI Multi-Agent Meta Framework` is an async-first meta framework for building, deploying, and scaling multi-agent systems for modern enterprise environments. It provides:

- [eggai SDK](#eggai-sdk): Essential primitives to streamline multi-agent system development.
- [Extensive examples](#examples): Proven patterns, best practices, and integrations with popular AI frameworks.

By handling the complexities of distributed systems, EggAI frees developers to focus on business logic and deliver value faster.

## Features

- 🤖 **Agent Management**: Simplify the orchestration and execution of multi-agent systems.
- 🚀 **Async-First**: Push-based APIs designed for high-concurrency, long-running and real-time processes.
- ⚡ **Event-Driven**: Enable adaptive and responsive system behaviors triggered by real-time events.
- 📈 **Horizontally Scalable**: Scale agent execution seamlessly to meet growing demands.
- 🚇 **Kafka Integration**: Native support for Kafka topics ensures seamless streaming and messaging.
- 🛠 **Flexible Architecture**: Easily adapt or extend components without disrupting workflows.
- 🔄 **Resilient by Design**: Built-in retry mechanisms and fault tolerance for production-grade robustness.

## EggAI SDK

**EggAI SDK** provides essential primitives like `Agent` and `Channel` to enable seamless communication within multi-agent systems. It also integrates easily with specialized frameworks like [DSPy](https://dspy.ai/), [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), or [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/), so you can build a highly customizable and extensible environment tailored to your enterprise needs.

### Installation

Install `eggai` via pip:

```bash
pip install eggai
```

### Getting Started

Here's how you can quickly set up an agent to handle events in an event-driven system:

```python
import asyncio

from eggai import Agent, Channel

agent = Agent("OrderAgent")
channel = Channel()

@agent.subscribe(event_name="order_requested")
async def handle_order_requested(event):
    print(f"[ORDER AGENT]: Received order request. Event: {event}")
    await channel.publish({"event_name": "order_created", "payload": event})

@agent.subscribe(event_name="order_created")
async def handle_order_created(event):
    print(f"[ORDER AGENT]: Order created. Event: {event}")

async def main():
    await agent.run()
    await channel.publish({
        "event_name": "order_requested",
        "payload": {
            "product": "Laptop",
            "quantity": 1
        }
    })

    try:
        print("Agent is running. Press Ctrl+C to stop.")
        await asyncio.Event().wait()
    except asyncio.exceptions.CancelledError:
        print("Task was cancelled. Cleaning up...")
    finally:
        # Clean up resources
        await agent.stop()
        await channel.stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

Copy this snippet into your project, customize it, and you’re good to go!

### Core Concepts

An `Agent` is an isolated unit of business logic designed to orchestrate workflows, process events, and communicate with external systems such as LLMs and APIs.
It reduces boilerplate while supporting complex and long-running workflows. Key features include:

- **Event Handling**: Use the `subscribe` decorator to bind user-defined handlers to specific events.
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Manage long-running workflows and tasks efficiently.
- **External System Communication**: Seamlessly interact with Large Language Models (LLMs), external APIs, and other systems.
- **Lifecycle Management**: Automatically handle the lifecycle of Kafka consumers, producers, and other connected components.
- **Boilerplate Reduction**: Focus on core business logic while leveraging built-in integrations for messaging and workflows.

A `Channel` is the foundational communication layer that facilitates both event publishing and subscription.
It abstracts Kafka producers and consumers, enabling efficient and flexible event-driven operations. Key features include:

- **Event Communication**: Publish events to Kafka topics with ease.
- **Event Subscription**: Subscribe to Kafka topics and process events directly through the `Channel`.
- **Shared Resources**: Optimize resource usage by managing singleton Kafka producers and consumers across multiple agents or channels.
- **Seamless Integration**: Act as a communication hub, supporting both Agents and other system components.
- **Flexibility**: Allow Agents to leverage Channels for both publishing and subscribing, reducing complexity and duplication.

### Why Copy/Paste?

**1. Full Ownership and Control**  
By copying and pasting, you have direct access to the underlying implementation. Tweak or rewrite as you see fit, the code is truly yours.

**2. Separation of Concerns**  
Just like decoupling design from implementation, copying code (rather than installing a monolithic dependency) reduces friction if you want to restyle or refactor how agents are structured.

**3. Flexibility**  
Not everyone wants a one-size-fits-all library. With copy/paste “recipes,” you can integrate only the parts you need.

**4. No Hidden Coupling**  
Sometimes, prepackaged frameworks lock in design decisions. By copying from examples, you choose exactly what gets included and how it’s used.
